# *Brewery Dashboard*

Created by: **Timothy Sims**

This web app: **Displays different breweries obtained from the [openbrewerydb](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/) API and allows the user to sort in a number of ways. First you can sort in ascending/descending order by the name, type, location, or phone number. You can filter to show only the breweries with websites, those with a name that is either above or below a certain character count, and filter by the type of brewery. The app also includes a dashboard that contains multiple datapoints about the count of breweries, most common types, most common area code, and the amount of each brewery type.**
